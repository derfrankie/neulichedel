# Frank Neulichedel is really FrankNeulichedl

My name is Frank Neulichedl - Product Manager and Digital Designer with a strong passion for innovative products. I love to create awesome products via great UX, beautiful UI and modern interactions.


This is how I would describe me and my name - but if you ask around, most people would call me Frank Neulichedel. Actually to be more precise, mostly german people would mispell my surname to Neulichedel because it is composed seamingly (as so many german words) by two separate real german words: Neulich and Edel ... 

And they might not even be wrong. If you look into the archives of Bolzano you will find an entry where a certain Michael Neulichedel notorizes the lending of a garden in 1485 AD. But already then the name is spelled one time Neulichedel and one time Neulichedl ðŸ˜† 

Here is the full text from the Archives (in old german)

I figured that the confusion comes from the German dialect spoken in my home country. It's German, but an older version of German which didn't evolve like the rest. Some sounds are different and some words contracted or expanded over the centuries. Edl in dialect means Edel in Hochdeutsch (official written German) - you can see where the confusion between Neulichedel and Neulichedl comes from.

To be honest my whole life people had problems with my surname and I did get used to it pretty quickly. I found it to be a good thing - it helped me to not take me to seriously and accept that it's not the name that defines me but what I think and do ðŸ˜„
